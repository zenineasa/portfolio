The micromilling machine that existed in our lab has a contact probe that works for conductive materials; the principle being that the tool is connected to one terminal and workpiece to the other, and when they touch, the circuit gets completed. To make this work for a non-conductive tool or workpiece, I hacked the machine using a secondary circuit that utilizes a few piezoelectric sensors that trigger the aforementioned circuit completion based on incoming pressure variation. This helped our institute cut costs by avoiding the purchase of new equipment.",
